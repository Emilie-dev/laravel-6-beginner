# laravel-6-beginner

This project allowed me to work with **Laravel 6**.

In this project I work with a **sqlite database**. All information entered by the user is saved in the database.

In the menu I put three links:

-   a link to the About page
-   a link to the Services page
-   a link to the Customers page

On the Services page, the user can add a service and see it in a list.

In the Customers page, a **CRUD system** is used to manage the customer list.
